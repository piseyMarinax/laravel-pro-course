##  Custom config laravel

- First we should be able to define out own custom keys in any of the configuration files that we have.
- Second we should also be able to create our own custom configuration files in applications.
- Third we should  also be able to create our own custom ENV key which we can reference from any of the configuration files 
Note: most importantly we remember never to user the env file in our applications.
